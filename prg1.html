       <h2>HTML</h2>
         <p align="center" > HTML stands for Hyper Text Markup Language. HTML is the standard markup language for creating Web pages. HTML describes the structure of a Web page.
            HTML is a set of symbols or codes inserted into a file that's intended to be displayed on the internet. The markup tells web browsers how to display a web page's words and images. HTML markup tags specify document elements such as headings, paragraphs, and tables.
